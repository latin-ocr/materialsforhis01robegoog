of that letter, half a century after the murder of the
archbishop, we find'from the History of the Priors of

Canterhuryin the “ Anglia Sacra,’'¹ that the initial “ W.'' ·
in the heading of the letter is to be interpreted as mean-
ing not Williom, but Walter.

It would seem that William held some office in con-
nexion with the tomh of St. Thomas, aa we find him
receiving pilgrims and listening to their storias.2 He

which were reported to him; and when urged by his
brethren to arrange his collectione for publication, he tells
us that he was encouraged by repeated appearanoes of
the saint³ It was about savanteen months alter the
murder-ata. in May, lua-thas a third vision induced
him to seek the assistance of a brother monk who had
already been engaged on the subject3 and when the
book of Miracles was completed the writer was sent by
the convent of Ohristchurch to present it to the king in
eompliance with Hemy's own request.⁴ The Life of the
archbishop was probably composed after tha book of
1111116161,5 and thera is no reason for supposing that it too
was presented to the king, who could not have been
pleased with the ironica] tone in which the writer notices
bis vindication of himself from a share in the guilt of the
murder.⁶ Nor indeed, 11 he looked into the “ Minonis?
can he have felt himself flattered by the manner in which
tho writer repeatedly danounces the Irish war,⁷ although
Henry's invasion of Irelandhad been expressly sanctioned
by the authority of Pope Adrian IV.

The Winchester manuscript, from which the following
pagos are printed, is a small folio, of the latter part of the
thirteenth century, and is in excellent preservation,
