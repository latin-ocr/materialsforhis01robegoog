1110 isone 01 the many mediaeval chronicles which assume the character 01 0
history 01 the world. 11 begins with the creatiou, aud is brought down 10 the
author's own 11010, 110 reign 01 Edward 111 Prefixed to the historical portion, 11
1101ορ101 devoted to geography, in which 10 given adescription 01 every known
land. 11“0 say that the Polychronicou was written in the 1001100011 centuryis to
say that it is 001 free from inaccuracies. It has, however, 0 101110 apert from its
intrinsic merita. It enables 00 10 10101 0 very fair estimate 01 110 knowledge 01
history and geography which well-informed readers 0111010011001111 and fisteeuth
centurias possessed, for it was then the standard work 00 general history.

The two English translations, which are printed with the original Latin, afford
interesting illustratione 01110 graduul change of our language, for one was made
iu 110 1001100011 century, the other in the fiftecnth. The differences between
Trevisa’s version 0110110101 the unknown writer are 01100 considerable.

These two treatises, though they cannot rank as independent narratires, are
nevertheless 10100110 as 00101111 abstracta 01 previous historiens, especially “ La

interesting to the philologist ns instances 01 semi-Saxonized French.

Itis supposed that Peter 01 Ickham must have been the author, but no certain
conclusion on that point has been arrived at.
