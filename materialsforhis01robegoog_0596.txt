As far back as the year reoda Committee of the House of Commons
recommended that Indexes and Calendars should be made to the Public
Records, and thirty-six years afterwards another Committeo of the House af
Commons reiterated that recommendation in more forcible words; but it
was not until the incorporation of the State Paper Office with the Publia
Record Office that the Master of the Rolls found himself in a position to take
tho necessary steps for carrying out the wishes of the House of commone.

0n 7 December 1855, he stated to the Lords of the Treasnry tlrat although
‘⁸ the Records, State Papers‚ and Documenta in his charge constitute the most
“complete and perfect series of their kind in the civilized world,” and
although “they are of the greatest valae ina historicsl and constitutional
“ point of view, yet they are comparatirely useless to the public, from tha
⁴⁴ want of proper Calendars and Indexes.''

Acting upon the recommendatione of the Committees of the Hense of
Commons above referred to, he suggested to the Lords of the Treasury that
to effect the object he had in view it would be necessary for him to employ a
few persons fully qnalisscd to perform the work which he contemplated.

Their Lordships asserted to the necessity of having Calendars prepared
and printed, and empowcred the Master of the Rolls to take such steps as
might be necessary for this purpose.

The following Works hare been already published under the direction ol
the Master of the Rolls :-

Edited by Caranus Roarms, Esq.‚ Secretary of the Publio Reemd

and lauded gentry.
